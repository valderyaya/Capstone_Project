- the method of saving graph need to optimize

- move FlattenTreeDecomposition.h into TreeDecomposition.h

- in TreeDecomposition.h, connectedComponents() and contractDuplicateBags() use unordered_set<int> instead of set<Bag<int>>. // need to check again . after contraction , need renuber?

- [ ] niceTree's root need to choose carefully
